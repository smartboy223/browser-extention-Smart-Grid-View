Multi-Tab Grid — Quick Guide

Purpose
- View multiple websites in a grid and control layout, zoom, and fit.

Controls (top-right bar)
- Theme: switch between dark/light.
- Fit: cycles native → contain → cover to fit site content inside each cell.
- Aspect: toggle fill ↔ square to change cell proportions.
- Zoom In/Out: scales the whole grid; toolbar size stays constant.
- Auto-hide: the bar hides after ~20s of inactivity and reappears on move/click.

Labels and Dragging
- Each cell has a small centered label for the site name.
- Drag the cell using the small round grab handle next to the label text.
- The label itself is click-through so the website beneath stays interactive.

Reordering Cells
- Click and drag a cell (using the grab handle) over another cell.
- When dragging, the website content is temporarily non-interactive to ensure smooth reordering.
- Release to drop; layout and storage update automatically.

Cell Actions
- Hover a cell to reveal its small buttons:
- Open: opens the site in a new browser tab.
- Reload: refreshes the site inside the cell.
- Only the buttons are clickable; empty overlay areas allow clicks to pass through.

Zoom and Readability
- Page zoom is saved per grid view; labels scale to remain readable.
- The toolbar uses inverse scaling so it doesn’t shrink or crowd when you zoom out.

Troubleshooting
- Can’t click the site: ensure you’re not clicking directly on a button or grab handle.
- Site won’t load (blocked embedding): use the Open button; some sites set X-Frame-Options/CSP.
- Drag not working: start drag from the grab handle; try different zoom levels.

Notes
- Your layout and settings persist using local browser storage.
- This grid page is designed to keep interactive website controls accessible.
